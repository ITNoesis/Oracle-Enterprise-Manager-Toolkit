# OEM OMS Clone Automation using Ansible

This repository provides a fully automated Ansible playbook to clone Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) Cloud Control OMS to a new Linux server. With the exception of cloning the repository database and assumes that the database clone has been performed successfully. I plan to add a role for db_duplicate in a future release.

## Supported OEM Versions:
- Oracle Enterprise Manager 13.4
- Oracle Enterprise Manager 13.5

---

## High-Level Steps Performed:
- Copy EMKey to repository
- Clone OEM repository database (manual step, validation included)
- Create and copy OMS binary
- Install Agent in `softwareOnly` mode
- Automatically detect OEM version
- Conditional execution of OPSS schema recreation for OEM 13.4 and below
- OMS clone
- Plugin configuration
- OMS startup and validation
- Agent configuration and health check

---

## Prerequisites:

- Python 3 and Ansible 2.10+
- Oracle user access on source and target servers
- Manual clone of the repository DB via RMAN (this is validated, not performed)
- All binaries: agent ZIP, OMS clone JAR, software library tar file should be prepared and copied beforehand

# Running the Playbook
```shell
ansible-playbook -i your_inventory_loc/hosts.yml clone_oms.yml -f 1 -e 'source_server=<Source_OEM_Server> target_server=<Target_OEM_Server>'
```

# Notes

OPSS schema recreation is automatically triggered if OEM version â‰¤ 13.4.
Ensure database connectivity, permissions, and binaries are in place before starting.
DB cloning via RMAN must be handled manually but validated by this playbook.
