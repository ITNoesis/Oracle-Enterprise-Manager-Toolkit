# Oracle Cloud Observability and Management
This repository is collection of scripts, utilities, and tools to simplify and automate common administrative tasks with Oracle Cloud Observability and Management.
At this time, I did not see additional value to add a separate repo for just one playbook however, that might change once I have a higher number.
